I'm Aditi and I enjoy developing software for good, for fun, and for security. I enjoy backend development and solving complex algorithmic problems in cross-disciplinary spaces.

I'm currently living in Pittsburgh, finishing up my master's degree in Electrical/Computer Engineering (ECE) at Carnegie Mellon. During my undergrad at CMU, I double-majored in ECE and Philosophy, with a concentration in ethics. Now, I enjoy writing [pragmatic theory](https://aditinnara.github.io/blog/category/pragmatism/), [social and political philosophy](https://aditinnara.github.io/blog/category/social-political-philosophy/), and [philosophy of science](https://aditinnara.github.io/blog/category/nature-of-scientific-revolution/).

I created a tech ethics organization called the [HOPEful Engineering Collective](https://hopefulengineering.org/) with Dr. Michael Skirpan, and currently serve as the graduate lead. I also create and host [community engagement events](https://aditinnara.github.io/projects/#category-community-engagement) as the head of [TEDxCMU](https://www.tedxcmu.org/) Salon.

In my spare time, I read scifi and watch horror movies, take photos of [beautiful things](https://www.instagram.com/adhyllic/) with my Nikon D60, and listen to old Tamil movie songs.
