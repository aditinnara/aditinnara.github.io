In the fall of 2023, I was introduced to Dr. Michael Skirpan, who had the idea to create a mentorship network for engineering students who were interested in tech ethics, academia, or non-traditional tech pathways. He invited me to work on the project with him as his graduate student lead, and we spent an entire semester ideating and coming up with a framing for what we now call the [HOPEful Engineering Collective](https://hopefulengineering.org/). I felt that students didn't have many spaces at CMU where they felt like they could talk openly about tech ethics, and where they felt like they were peers with everyone in the room. Thus, we made that space available. The goal of HOPEful is to create open, honest conversations about tech ethics where everyone in the room could learn from everyone else.

**Fall 2024 Social**

For the Fall 2024 social event, I made conversation cards themed around central ideas of HOPEful. Guests sat at tables with people they hadn't met and had conversations with the cards as a guide. Then, they distilled their conversations into post-it notes, which they stuck up on a posterboard before moving to the next table.

        <div class="caption text-center"><em>Fears card.</em></div>
    </div>

The conversation cards were a success and people really enjoyed talking to people they hadn't met. Students engaged with faculty, professionals engaged with non-professionals, and everyone who came by felt like they had learned something new. Afterwards, I created a newsletter summarizing the major topics we discussed in order to archive our group takeaways.

**Consequential Coffee with Arthi Krishnaswami**

Our next event was the first event of a series of events we call Consequential Coffee. We invite local professionals to bring a topic of conversation to a coffee chat with interested students. With Consequential Coffee, we aim to create connections with students and professionals in their field of interest, as well as a general understanding of various topics that are not often discussed in a university setting.

Our first Consequential Coffee was with Arthi Krishnaswami, who presented the topic of Making Ideas Real.

**Tactics for Ethical Tech**

Our next event was a panel event we called Tactics for Ethical Technology.

We brought in four speakers, each of whom brought in a topic. The topics we discussed were Equitable Medical AI with Merage Ghane, Public Algorithms with Rayid Ghani, Building Networks with Maryam Farooq, and Evaluating AI with Fernando Diaz.

        <div class="caption text-center"><em></em></div>
    </div>
</div>

Students came in to speak to the panelists they were interested in, but most ended up staying for the whole event. Towards the end, everyone got in a roundtable-style discussion, where we talked about the state of standards organizations in technology, teaching AI literacy, how AI should be used responsibly, and general fears and feelings about the tech industry.

**Research**

In parallel to the events I create for HOPEful, I also work with Dr. Skirpan to research the efficacy of tech ethics interventions at other universities. We aim to learn what kinds of interventions (classroom, university, student groups, etc.) arm students to enact change once they graduate and enter the workforce. Please email me at [aditin@andrew.cmu.edu](aditin@andrew.cmu.edu) if you want to chat about our research or have any ideas about HOPEful.
